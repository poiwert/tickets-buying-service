He travels to the Empty Quarter in the Arabian Desert, briefly reunites with Ilsa and tells her to lay low. Back in the US, Ethan infiltrates a meeting of the Community, where officials of various intelligence agencies, including former IMF director Eugene Kittridge and DNI Denlinger, discuss an experimental AI called the Entity. Originally designed to sabotage digital systems, the Entity went rogue, expanded to potential sentience, and infiltrated all major defense and military systems and intelligence networks. Major powers are racing both to prevent sabotage and to gain control of the Entity.\n");
